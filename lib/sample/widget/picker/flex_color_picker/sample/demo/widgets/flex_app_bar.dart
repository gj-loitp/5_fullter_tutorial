/// The [FlexAppBar] has the same features as a normal [AppBar], but provides
/// additional custom styling properties.
///
/// An app bar consists of a toolbar and potentially other widgets, such as a
/// [TabBar] and a [FlexibleSpaceBar]. App bars typically expose one or more
/// common [actions] with [IconButton]s which are optionally followed by a
/// [PopupMenuButton] for less common operations (sometimes called the "overflow
/// menu").
///
/// App bars are typically used in the [Scaffold.appBar] property, which places
/// the app bar as a fixed-height widget at the top of the screen. For a
/// scrollable app bar, see [SliverAppBar], which embeds an [AppBar] in a
/// sliver for use in a [CustomScrollView].
///
/// The AppBar displays the toolbar widgets, [leading], [title], and [actions],
/// above the [bottom] (if any). The [bottom] is usually used for a [TabBar]. If
/// a [flexibleSpace] widget is specified then it is stacked behind the toolbar
/// and the bottom widget. The following diagram shows where each of these slots
/// appears in the toolbar when the writing language is left-to-right (e.g.
/// English):
///
/// The [AppBar] insets its content based on the ambient [MediaQuery]'s padding,
/// to avoid system UI intrusions. It's taken care of by [Scaffold] when used in
/// the [Scaffold.appBar] property. When animating an [AppBar], unexpected
/// [MediaQuery] changes (as is common in [Hero] animations) may cause the
/// content to suddenly jump. Wrap the [AppBar] in a [MediaQuery] widget, and
/// adjust its padding such that the animation is smooth.
///
/// The leading widget is in the top left, the actions are in the top right,
/// the title is between them. The bottom is, naturally, at the bottom, and the
/// flexibleSpace is behind all of them.
/// (https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/app_bar.png)
///
/// If the [leading] widget is omitted, but the [AppBar] is in a [Scaffold] with
/// a [Drawer], then a button will be inserted to open the drawer. Otherwise, if
/// the nearest [Navigator] has any previous routes, a [BackButton] is inserted
/// instead. This behavior can be turned off by setting the
/// [automaticallyImplyLeading] to false. In that case a null leading widget
/// will result in the middle/title widget stretching to start.
